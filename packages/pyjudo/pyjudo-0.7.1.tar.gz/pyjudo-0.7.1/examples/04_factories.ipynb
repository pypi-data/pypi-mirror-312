    "So far we have looked at ways of registering classes and retrieving instances of those classes with the `ServiceContainer`. This will get us most of the way when developing a system using dependency injection, but in some situations we may want to have finer control over when the instances of our classes are created. This is typically done by using a \"Factory\".  \n",
