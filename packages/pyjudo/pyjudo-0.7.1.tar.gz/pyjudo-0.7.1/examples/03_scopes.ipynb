    "As discussed in [02 Service Lifetimes](02_lifetimes.ipynb), services in a `ServiceContainer` can have a lifetime associated with them.\n",
    "To briefly recap, service lifetimes can be defined as:\n",
    " - Transient: a new service instance is created each time it is retrieved\n",
    " - Scoped: a single instance is created per scope\n",
    " - Singleton: a single instance is created per `ServiceContainer`\n",
    "\n",
    "Transient and Singleton services are fairly simple to understand, and don't require any additional mechanics to make use of them. However, Scoped services require a `Scope`.\n",

    "**What is a Scope?**  \n",
    "A scope acts as a boundary within which scoped services are instantiated and managed. Think of a scope as a distinct context or environment that controls the lifecycle of its scoped services. This ensures that within a given scope:\n",
    " - Scoped services are created once and reused whenever requested.\n",
    " - Transient and Singleton services behave consistently across scopes, adhering to their respective lifetimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Scopes Work**  \n",
    "Each scope maintains its own set of scoped service instances. This means that scoped services within one scope are isolated from those in another, preventing unintended sharing or conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new scope is created, it inherits all the service registrations from the parent `ServiceContainer`. However, for scoped services, the scope ensures that new instances are provided within its boundary while respecting singleton and transient lifetimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a scope is exited, it is typical that all scoped service instances within it are disposed. This automatic cleanup helps manage resources efficiently and avoids memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scopes operate with a stack. When you enter into a new scope, it is pushed to the top of the stack. And conversly, when you exit from a scope, it is popped from the top of the stack. When you retrieve a scoped service from the `ServiceCollection`, it will retrieve it from the top of the scope stack.  \n",
    "In PyJudo, there is no \"base\" or \"global\" scope, you need to explicitly enter a new scope. Trying to retrieve a service without entering a scope will throw an exception*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Scopes**  \n",
    "Scoped services are ideal in scenarios where you need:\n",
    " - \"Per-request\" Lifetimes  \n",
    "   For example, in web applications it is typical to create a new scope for each HTTP request. This ensures that services are consistent throughout the handling of that request but isolated from others.\n",
    "\n",
    " - \"Operational\" Services\n",
    "   When services hold resources that should be released after a specific operation or context. Scoped lifetimes ensure isolation from other (sometimes concurrent) operations and provide a post-operation disposal mechanism.\n"

    "> It is debatable whether there should be a \"global\" scope, but I'm of the opinion that this is a poor design.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> Services which are scoped imply they have an expiration and should be disposed of. A \"global\" scope would not be disposed of until the container is disposed, meaning scoped services resolved in the \"global\" scope are effectively implicit singletons.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> I think it's better to explicitly define that behaviour to prevent accidental misuse; thus, scoped services cannot be resolved unless within an explicitly defined scope."
