    If a class is decorated, a new instance of it is used as info object:
    The class should have a `newdepth` method that will be called before each depth, and a `process` method that takes a key and yields subsequent keys as in the function case.
    The info object is kept updated with the list of `currentkeys`, current `depth` and the set of `donekeys`.
    Note that the first `currentkeys` (`depth` 0) is exactly the passed in `keys` iterable, subsequent `currentkeys` will be non-empty lists.
    The process function is only invoked for keys that have not yet been processed, i.e. unique keys.
    When finished the decorated function/class is replaced with the last state of the info object.'''
