Getting Started
===============

Basic usage
-----------

To discover, which outdated packages in GURU are installed on your system, run:

.. prompt:: bash

   find-work -I repology -r gentoo_ovl_guru outdated

.. tip::

   * ``-I`` flag is a filter to display installed packages only. Global flags
     must precede module name.
   * ``repology`` is a module. Every data source is in its own module.
   * ``-r <repo>`` specifies repository name on Repology. Module flags
     must precede command name.
   * ``outdated`` is a command in the ``repology`` module.

   .. seealso:: :manpage:`find-work.1` manual page

You can use short command aliases, for example:

.. prompt:: bash

   find-work -I rep -r gentoo_ovl_guru out

Multiple result reporters are supported:

.. prompt:: bash

   find-work -R list

All data from APIs is cached for a day, so don't hesitate running the command
again and again!
