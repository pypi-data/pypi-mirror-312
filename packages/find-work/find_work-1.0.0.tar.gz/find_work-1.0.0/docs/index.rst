Introduction
============

find-work is a fun little tool that lets you discover what you can do for Gentoo
as a package maintainer. It contains filters to show only packages you might be
interested in.

With the right plug-ins installed, find-work can use multiple data sources, such
as Repology, Gentoo Bugzilla and pkgcheck.

If you want to learn how to use find-work, check out the following resources:

* :doc:`installation`
* :doc:`getting-started`

If you want to develop a new plugin, please refer to :doc:`reference`.
