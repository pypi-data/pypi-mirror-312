Release Notes
=============

1.0.0
------------

- **New**: Filter results by package category.

- **New**: XML results reporter.

- **New**: JSON results reporter.

- Fix compatibility with Python 3.11.

*Dependencies introduced:*

* :pypi:`typing_extensions`

*Dependencies removed:*

* :pypi:`gentoopm`

0.990.0
-------

- **Breaking**: Split the program into two Python packages (``core`` and
  ``app``). All plugins need to be updated accordingly.

- **Breaking**: Make entry points used by the package versioned for forward and
  backward compatibility.

- **Breaking**: Rename the implementation hook for plugins from ``hook_impl`` to
  ``cli_hook_impl``.

- **Breaking**: Split result types into a separate Python module.

- Add result reporters. Result reporter is a Python class, which is loadable via
  entry points and can output results of a certain type to the standard output.

- Add built-in result reporters for console and HTML.
  
- Add an option to list result reporters with ``find-work -R list``.

- Display exit messages to the standard error.

0.91.2
------

- Fix package name extraction algorithm. It is now based solely on regular
  expressions and might work more correctly than the previous approach.

- Include a Makefile to install manpages and shell completions in the sdist
  again.

- Add a little message in the ``--help`` output mentioning there's a man page.

0.91.1
------

- Fix options defined in custom commands.

- Improve start-up time by deferring loading of custom aliases.

  ``/etc/find-work/config.toml``.

- Process custom global flags in a more thoughtful way.

0.91.0
------

- **Breaking**: Plugins need to use ``find_work.plugins`` entry point group in
  order to register themselves. Turns out the former name was incorrect and
  broke many unrelated packages!

0.90.0
------

- **Breaking**: Modules are no longer shipped with find-work but installed as
  loadable plug-ins instead.

- **Breaking**: If you had custom aliases, you need to change ``command`` from
  a fully qualified import name to ``"plugin:command"`` syntax.

- **Gone**: ``pgo`` module, as Gentoo Packages website does no longer have
  GraphQL API.

- Implement Pydantic-based config parsing.

- Use striсter type validation here and here.

*Dependencies introduced:*

* :pypi:`pluggy`

0.7.0

-----
