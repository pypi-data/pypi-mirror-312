Plotly opens a new tab in a browser each time it is used.  I am not sure how to fix this as searching for solutions for a while did not bring up any browser settings that could be modified.

Have not tested this in Jupyter Notebooks.  I don't think it will work yet in Jupyter Notebooks but you can try.

The spectral trace success relies on a decent to good Gaussian fit in spatial direction at every ~20-50 columns, so this could fail entirely on spectra that are very out of focus and show double peaks.  I plan to fix this and make it more flexible in a future update.

When running epar_imXam.py, "Greys" is the only option for color map at the moment.  Will be changed in the future.

Note 1: the first time you use imXam, it will take longer than normal to start b/c it's creating
all those pycache/ folders.

Note 2: imXam requires vim, which is already installed on most systems that use UNIX (make sure that your
system has vim, not vi).

Note 3: For Linux, one may have to do the following:  
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0 
or 
sudo apt install --reinstall libxcb-cursor0 
or
sudo apt-get install --reinstall libxcb-xinerama0

Note 4: The default version of PyQtGraph encounters a problem with Python 3.11:
https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105497
This fix won't get pushed until August 2023.  In the meantime, I've made the necessary
fixes to ROI.py in PyQtGraph.

Note 5: This should work with Intel processors on a Mac.  For M1/2 processors, a build for PyQt6 should be available soon.
