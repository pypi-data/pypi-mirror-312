           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Pyinsee - insee API Client

The Insee Client package is a Python library that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Insee API. It allows you to retrieve legal data, such as company information, and save it to a dataset.



## Installation

To install the Insee Client package, run the following command:

```shell
  pip install pyinsee
```

Or 

```shell
  pip install git+https://github.com/AymanKUMA/insee-client.git 
```


## Initial usage

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file.

The Insee Client package provides a command-line interface (CLI) for setting up environment variables. You can use the CLI by running the following command:

```shell
setup-cli --help
```
Output:
```

     '''  '''' '     |    Welcome to the .env setup CLI!
    ------------------------------------------------------


usage: py-insee-setup [-h] [--env-path ENV_PATH] --data-dir DATA_DIR [--client-key CLIENT_KEY] [--client-secret CLIENT_SECRET] [--api-key API_KEY] [--api-url API_URL] [--overwrite]

Set up the .env file for the application.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --env-path ENV_PATH   Path to the .env file.
  --data-dir DATA_DIR   Path to the data directory.
  --client-key CLIENT_KEY
                        client key for the API.
  --client-secret CLIENT_SECRET
                        client secret for the API.
  --api-key API_KEY     API key for the API, set it up only in case the OAuth flow doesn't work.
  --api-url API_URL     API base URL.
  --overwrite           Overwrite the existing .env file.
```

Note that the .env file will be created automatically via the CLI. 

You will be prompted to provide the following values:

* Data output directory (default: data)
* Insee API consumer key
* Insee API consumer secret
* API URL (default: https://api.insee.fr/api-sirene/3.11/)

If a .env file already exists at the specified path, you will be asked if you want to update the file.

Once the environment variables are available you can start using the insee-cli or the python module.




## Usage/Examples

### Insee CLI

Using py-insee cli you can either retrive bulk data, or a single data either by "*siren*" or "*siret*": 
```
usage: py-insee  [-h] {insee_get_bulk,insee_get_by_number} ...

CLI for querying INSEE data.

positional arguments:
  {insee_get_bulk,insee_get_by_number}
    insee_get_bulk      Fetch bulk data from INSEE API
    insee_get_by_number
                        Fetch legal data by number

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

The first option is getting bulk data: 
```
usage: py-insee  insee_get_bulk [-h] [--q Q] [--date DATE] [--curse
CURSEUR] [--debut DEBUT] [--nombre NOMBRE] [--tri [TRI ...]] [--cham
[CHAMPS ...]] [--facette [FACETTE ...]] [--mvn MVN] [--save SAVE]
                                
                                {siren,siret} {json,csv}

positional arguments:
  {siren,siret}         Type of data to retrieve
  {json,csv}            Content type of the response

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --q Q                 Query parameter
  --date DATE           Date parameter (YYYY-MM-DD)
  --curseur CURSEUR     Cursor parameter (start value = *) Then you'll get the next cursor in the response
  --debut DEBUT         Start date or number
  --nombre NOMBRE       Number of items
  --tri [TRI ...]       Sorting criteria
  --champs [CHAMPS ...]
                        Fields to retrieve
  --facette [FACETTE ...]
                        Facette fields
  --mvn MVN             Hide null values (true/false)
  --save SAVE           Save data to a file

```

The first option is getting data by number:

```
usage: py-insee insee_get_by_number [-h] [--date DATE] [--champs [CHAMPS ...]] [--mvn MVN] [--save SAVE] {siren,siret} id_code

positional arguments:
  {siren,siret}         Type of data to retrieve
  id_code               ID code of the company

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --date DATE           Date parameter (YYYY-MM-DD)
  --champs [CHAMPS ...]
                        Fields to retrieve
  --mvn MVN             Hide null values (true/false)
  --save SAVE           Save data to a file
```

If the argument '**save**' is not provided the CLI display the results. Note that the data is saved in the directory *data/raw/...*

### Python usage
Setup the envirement variable via the cli in your project and then import the Client from the pyinsee: 

```python
from pyinsee.insee_client import InseeClient
```

1. **Get data bulk :**
Get bulk data of either siren or siret numbers: 

```
get_bulk(data_type: 'str' = 'siren', **kwargs: 'BulkParams') -> 'dict' method of pyinsee.insee_client.InseeClient instance
    Get bulk data (SIREN or SIRET) from INSEE API.

    Args:
        data_type (str): The type of data to retrieve, either "siren" or "siret".
        **kwargs (dict | None): The query parameters for the API request.
            q: str
            date: str
            curseur: str
            debut: (str, int)

            tri: (str, list)
            champs: (str, list)
            facette.champ: (str, list)
            masquerValeursNulles: (str, bool)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the query parameters are not valid or if `data_type` is not valid.

    Returns:
        dict: The response from the API.
```

**Example** 
```python 
# get bulk
client_bulk = InseeClient()

bulk_data, header = client_bulk.get_bulk(
  data_type="siren",
  nombre = 5,

)
```

2. **Get data by number :**
Get data either by Siren or Siret numbers.

        masquerValeurNulles: (str, bool)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the query parameters are not valid or if `data_type` is not valid.

    Returns:
        dict: The legal data for the company.
```

**Example**

```python
# get by number
client_by_number = InseeClient()

siren_data = client_by_number.get_by_number(
    data_type="siren",
    id_code = "000325175",
)
```
### Updates

The API provided by the INSEE has changed and currently I'm trying to use Oauth service to retrieve the API key instead of setting it manually.
