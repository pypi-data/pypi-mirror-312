  title: List of residues to be mutated
  short: List of residues to be mutated. By default all the interface residues are
    mutated.
  long: List of residues to be mutated. By default all the interface residues are
    mutated. resdic_* is an expandable parameter. You can provide resdic_A,
    resdic_B, resdic_C, etc, where the last capital letter is the chain
