Sudio is a Python library for audio processing and manipulation, providing set of tools for working with digital audio files. It supports operations like time-domain slicing, frequency filtering, audio mixing, streaming, and effect application across various audio formats, making complex audio engineering tasks accessible through a streamlined, Pythonic interface.


## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Installation

Install Sudio using pip:

```bash
pip install sudio --upgrade
```

### Basic Usage

Here's an example to get you started with sudio:

```python
import sudio
from sudio.process.fx import FadeEnvelope, FadePreset

# Initialize Sudio Master
su = sudio.Master()

# Load an audio file
song = su.add('track.ogg')

# Slice, mix, and transform audio with ease
remix = song[10: 30]  + song[10.15: 25: .95, :'300'] * -10
remix = remix.afx(FadeEnvelope, preset=FadePreset.LINEAR_FADE_IN)

# Play and export the transformed audio
su.echo(remix)
su.export(remix, 'remix.mp3')
```

 the original 20-second segment (10-30 seconds) is layered with a slightly time-shifted slice, filtered to low frequencies below 300 Hz, with .95 original speed, and dramatically attenuated by -10 dB to create a subtle, atmospheric undertone. The LINEAR_FADE_IN envelope effect adds a gradual volume increase, creating a smooth, building intensity to the remix.
