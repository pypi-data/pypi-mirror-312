    Finds the number closest to 'reference_number' that is divisible by 'divisor'.

    Args:
        reference_number (int): The reference number.
        divisor (int): The divisor.

    Returns:
        int: The number closest to 'reference_number' that is divisible by 'divisor'.

    Example:
