*rainbow* provides programmatic access to the raw data encoded in chromatography and mass spectrometry binary files. This library supports the following vendors and detectors:

**Agilent .D**
* `.uv` - UV spectrum (supports incomplete files)
* `.ch` - UV, FID, CAD, and ELSD channels
* `.ms` - MS (supports incomplete files)
* `MSProfile.bin` - HRMS

**Waters .raw**
* `CHRO` - CAD and ELSD, as well as miscellaneous analog data
* `FUNC` - UV and MS 

There is [documentation](http://rainbow-api.readthedocs.io/) for *rainbow* that also details the structure of each [binary file format](https://rainbow-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html).

## Installation

```
pip install rainbow-api
```

## Usage

The easiest way to get started is to give *rainbow* a directory path. Assume that we have a directory `mydata.D` that contains a binary file `DAD1.uv` with UV data. 

```python
import rainbow as rb
datadir = rb.read("mydata.D")
datafile = datadir.get_file("DAD1A.uv")
```

Here, the `datadir` DataDirectory object contains a DataFile object for `DAD1A.uv`. 
The raw UV data is contained in numpy arrays that are attributes of `datafile`. Users may find the following particularly useful:
* `datafile.xlabels` - 1D numpy array with retention times
* `datafile.ylabels` - 1D numpy array with wavelengths
* `datafile.data` - 2D numpy array with absorbances 

There is a [tutorial](https://rainbow-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) available. There are also example [snippets](https://rainbow-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) for basic tasks. Or just check out the full [API](https://rainbow-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html). 

## Contents
* `rainbow/` contains the code of the Python library.
* `docs/` contains code for generating documentation. To build documentation locally, you will need to install the `sphinx` and `sphinx-rtd-theme` packages. Then, move to the `docs/` directory and run `make html`. The docpages will be generated under `docs/_build`. 
* `tests/` contains unit tests for the library. These can be run with `python -m unittest`.
