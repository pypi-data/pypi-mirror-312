# trolo

A framework for harnessing the power of transformers with YOLO models and other single-shot detectors!

## Installation

```bash
pip install trolo
```

## Features

- üî• Transformer-enhanced object detection
- üéØ Single-shot detection capabilities  
- ‚ö° High performance inference
- üõ†Ô∏è Easy to use CLI interface
- üöÄ Fast video stream inference
- üß† Automatic DDP handling

## Quick Start

![pred_0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/144ae351-c520-4640-8081-3e9a0db9b432)

The CLI command structure is:

```bash
trolo [command] [options]
```
For detailed help:
```bash
trolo --help # for general help
trolo [command] --help # for command-specific help
```

### Inference

Example inference command:
```bash
trolo predict --model dfine-n # automatically downloads model from trolo model hub
```
Support for single image, image folder, and video input
```bash
trolo predict --model dfine-n.pth --input img.jpg # folder/ or video.mp4 or 0 (for webcam)
```

üî• Smart Video stream inference - infers on videos in streaming mode so you never have to worry about memory issues!

Python API:
```python
from trolo.inference import DetectionPredictor

predictor = DetectionPredictor(model="dfine-n")
predictions = predictor.predict() # get predictions
poltted_preds = predictor.visualize(show=True, save=True) # or get visualized outputs
```
Visit Inference Docs for more details


### Training
<b>Example training command:</b>
```bash
trolo train --config dfine_n # automatically find the config file
```

üî• Automatically handle DDP by simply passing the GPUs to the CLI
```bash
trolo train --config dfine_n --device 0,1,2,3 
```
That's it!

<b>Python API</b>

```python
from trolo.trainers import DetectionTrainer

trainer = DetectionTrainer(config="dfine_n") # or pass custom config path
trainer.train() # pass device = 0,1,2,3 to automatically handle DDP 
```

## Credits

This project builds upon several excellent open source projects:

- [D-FINE](https://github.com/Peterande/D-FINE): Original D-FINE model implementation
- [RT-DETR](https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR): Real-time DETR architecture
- [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection): Detection framework

- The original trainer is based on D-fine with major modifications for handling pre-trained weights, DDP, and other features.
- The architecture is for D-fine is same as the original paper and repo.
