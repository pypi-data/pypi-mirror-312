Deceiver is an open source software project that provides a library for testing third-party API usage. It offers special classes to create mock objects, allowing developers to mimic the behavior of external APIs and verify their usage without the need for actual network access. With Deceiver, developers can ensure the correct integration and interaction with third-party APIs, enabling efficient and reliable testing of API-dependent applications.
