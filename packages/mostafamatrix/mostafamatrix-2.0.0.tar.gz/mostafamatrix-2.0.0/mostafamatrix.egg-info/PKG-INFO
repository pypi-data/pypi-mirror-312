Description: # gldmabotaleb
        
        **gldmabotaleb** is a Python library (version 1.0.0) designed for modeling univariate time series using the first-order **Generalized Least Deviation Method (GLDM)**. This method leverages the previous time step value (yₜ₋₁) to forecast the current value (yₜ), providing accurate and efficient predictions for various time series applications.

        ## Input File Format
        The `input.txt` file should be formatted as follows:
        
        | **Line** | **Content** |                    **Description**                                 |
        |----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | 1        | `:`         | Separator indicating the start of data sections                    |
        | 2        | `m ts`      | - `m`: Length of the time series<br `ts`                           |
        | 3        | `yt`        | First data point of the first time series                          |
        | 4        | `yt_1`      | Second data point of the first time series                         |
        | 5        | `yt_2`      | Third data point of the first time series                          |
        | ...      | `...`       | ...                                                                |
        | `m*ts + 2` | `yt_m`    | `m`-th data point of the `ts`-th time series                       |
        
        
        The default input data is expected to be in a file named input.txt. The data structure should follow the format below, which is exemplified using an NDVI dataset:
        
        |**Data:**  **15      1**    |
        |----------------------------|
        |0.2950428571                |

        |0.4132                      |
        |0.3973                      |
        
        **Explanation:**
        **First Line (15 1):**
        **15**: Length of the time series data.
        **1**: Number of univariate time series (in this example we have only one time series).
        **Subsequent Lines**: Each line represents a data point in the time series.
        **Ensure that your input.txt follows this structure for the library to function correctly.**
        ## Usage
        Running the Model
        To utilize the gldmabotaleb library, follow these simple steps:
        ### **Prepare Your Data:** Ensure your data is saved in input.txt with the correct format.
        ### Run the Model:
        **import sys**
        **from gldmabotaleb import run**
        **run("input.txt")**
        **What Happens When You Run the Model**
        Model Execution: The GLDM model runs using the first-order method.
        **Automated Outputs:**
        **Figures:** Visualizations of the time series and forecasting results are saved automatically.
        **Output File (output.txt):** Contains model evaluations, Model coefficients (a_1,a_2), metrics, solution systems, time consumption, and memory usage.
        ## **Outputs**
        **After running the model, the following outputs are generated:**
        **Figures:** Visual representations of the time series data and forecasting results. These figures are typically saved in formats like .png in the directory where the script is executed.
        **output.txt:** A comprehensive report including:
        **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing the performance of the GLDM model (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error).
        **Solution System:** Details of the mathematical solution applied by the GLDM.
        **Performance Metrics:** Time taken to run the model and memory consumed during execution.
        ## **Example**
        Here's a step-by-step example to demonstrate how to use gldmabotaleb:
        1. Prepare input.txt
        Create a file named input.txt in the same directory as your script with the following content:
        
        |**Data:**  **15      1**    |
        |----------------------------|
        |0.2950428571                |
        |0.3935857143                |
        |0.5285714286                |
        |0.6218285714                |
        |0.6637285714                |
        |0.6701142857                |
        |0.6759714286                |
        |0.6935285714                |
        |0.6907857143                |
        |0.6777857143                |
        |0.6159142857                |
        |0.5291714286                |
        |0.4574714286                |
        |0.4132                      |
        |0.3973                      |
        
        2. Create and Run the Script
        Create a Python script (e.g., run_model.py) with the following content:
        import sys
        from gldmabotaleb import run
        # Run the GLDM model with the input data
        run("input.txt")
        3. Review the Outputs
        **Figures:** Check the generated visualizations in your directory. These may include plots of the original time series, forecasted values, and residuals.
        **output.txt:** Open the file to review model evaluations and performance metrics. This file provides insights into the accuracy and efficiency of the GLDM model applied to your data.
