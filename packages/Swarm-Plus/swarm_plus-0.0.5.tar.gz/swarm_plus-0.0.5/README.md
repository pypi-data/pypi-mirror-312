## Overview: 
Swarm-Plus is a versatile Python framework developed by Vishnu Durairaj, designed to facilitate the creation of intelligent AI agents equipped with a diverse range of tools and functionalities. This open-source framework simplifies the development of sophisticated AI systems capable of handling various tasks through role-based agents and supports advanced multi-agent orchestration.

## Features

- **Built-in User Interface**: Quickly create AI prototypes with a ready-to-use interf
- **Create AI Agents with Tools**: Easily build AI agents with a diverse set of tools.
- **Role-Based Agents**: Define agents with specific roles and responsibilities to handle different tasks and collaborate effectively.
- **Memory Management**: Efficiently handle conversation history with various memory options:
  - **ConversationBufferMemory**: Retains the entire conversation history. Use this when you need to maintain a complete record of all interactions without any summarization or truncation.
  - **ConversationBufferWindowMemory**: Retains only the last K messages in the conversation. Ideal for scenarios where you want to limit memory usage and only keep the most recent interactions. (`memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(last_k=3)`)
  - **ConversationSummaryMemory**: Automatically summarizes the conversation once it exceeds a specified number of messages. Use this to manage lengthy conversations by creating concise summaries while retaining overall context. (`memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(number_of_messages=5)`)
  - **ConversationSummaryBufferMemory**: Combines summarization with selective message retention. Summarizes the conversation after a certain point and retains only the most recent N messages. Perfect for balancing context preservation with memory constraints by keeping key recent interactions while summarizing earlier ones. (`memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(buffer_size=5)`)

## Example Use Case

### 1. Agents With Tools

Here’s an example of how to create a agent with tools using SwarmPlus:

#### Step 1: Import Required Modules

```python
import os
import nest_asyncio
from SwarmPlus.helper import print_colored
from SwarmPlus.agent import Agent
from SwarmPlus.models import OpenaiChatModel
from SwarmPlus.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from SwarmPlus.tools.FileOperationsTool import SaveFile, CreateFolder
```

#### Step 2. If you are running this script in a notebook uncomment this

```python
# nest_asyncio.apply()
```

#### Step 3. Prepare Agent Description and Instructions
```python
# This concise description helps in understanding the agent's responsibilities and guides the system 
# in determining what types of tasks should be assigned to this agent. 
description = "Responsible for writing story."

# Provide instructions for the agent (System Prompt)
instruction = "You are a creative storyteller who crafts imaginative narratives with vivid details, rich characters, and unexpected plot twists."
```

#### Step 4: Load pre-defined tools that the agent will use
```python
# These tools enable the agent to create folders and save files
tools = [CreateFolder, SaveFile]
```

#### Step 5: Set your OpenAI API key
```python
openai_api_key = "Your API Key"
# openai_api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

#### Step 6: Initialize the large language model for the agent
```python
model = OpenaiChatModel(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", api_key=openai_api_key, temperature=0)
```

#### Step 7: Initialize memory - 4 different techniques are available.
```python

memory = ConversationBufferMemory()        
# This option retains the entire conversation history. 
# Use this when you need to maintain a complete record of all interactions without any summarization or truncation.

# memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(last_k=3)    
# This option retains only the last K messages in the conversation.
# Ideal for scenarios where you want to limit memory usage and only keep the most recent interactions.

# memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(number_of_messages=5)   
# This option automatically summarizes the conversation once it exceeds a specified number of messages.
# Use this to manage lengthy conversations by creating concise summaries while retaining overall context.

# memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(buffer_size=5)    
# This option combines summarization with selective message retention. It summarizes the conversation after a certain point and retains only the most recent N messages.
# Perfect for balancing context preservation with memory constraints by keeping key recent interactions while summarizing earlier ones.
```

#### Step 8: Initialize the agent with the model, description, instructions, and tools. Set verbose to True to see the steps by step actions.
```python
agent = Agent(model=model, agent_name="AI Assistant", agent_description=description, agent_instructions=instruction, tools=tools, assistant_agents=[],max_allowed_attempts=5, verbose=True,memory=memory)
```

#### Step 9: Start the conversation

```python

print_colored("Starting the application...........", "green")

# Example user input
# user_input = "Create a story about AI agents and save it in a new folder. The story should have two chapters, and each chapter should be saved separately inside the folder"

# ---------------- With UI -------------------------

from SwarmPlus.demo import run_ui_demo

demo = run_ui_demo(agent=agent)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    demo.run()


# ---------------- In Terminal -------------------------

user_input = input("User : ")

# Initialize the messages list to store conversation history
messages = []

# Step 8: Process user input and interact with the agent
while user_input != "bye":
    # The agent processes the user input and generates a response
    output = agent.run(user_input, messages)

    # Update the messages list with the agent's response
    messages = output.messages

    # If verbose=False is set during agent initialization, uncomment the following line to see the agent's responses
    # print_colored(f"Assistant : {output}", "purple")

    # Prompt the user for the next input
    user_input = input("User Input : ")

```

### 2. Creating Custom Tools

Here’s an example of how to create a custom tool using pydantic base model:

```python
import os
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel,Field

class AppendToFile(BaseModel):
    # Based on this docstring, the model will determine when to use this tool. Ensure it clearly describes the tool's purpose.
    """
    Use this tool to append content to an existing file.
    """
    # Provides justification for selecting this tool, helping to ensure it is chosen appropriately and not at random. You can ignore this.
    reasoning :List[str] = Field(description="Why you are using this tool")

    # Thses are the required argument with its data types clearly declared.
    file_name: str = Field(..., description="File name to append to.") 
    content: str = Field(..., description="Content to append.")

    # Every tool must include a `run` method. This method will be called dynamically during interactions to perform the tool's primary function.
    def run(self):
        try:
            with open(self.file_name, "a") as file:
                file.write(self.content)
            return f"Content appended to file: {self.file_name}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred while appending to the file: {str(e)}"
    
AppendToFile(reasoning=["Thoughts"],file_name="path to the file",content="content to append").run()

```
