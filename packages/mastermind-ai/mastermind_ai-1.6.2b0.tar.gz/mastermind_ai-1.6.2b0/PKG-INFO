# Mastermind

> This is a python implementation of the classic puzzle game Mastermind. It simulates the game and allow you to play with either another human being (sits next to you) or the computer, with a AI Solver build-in (still under development). You can install this game with pip or try it out in your browser with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FlysonBot/Mastermind/blob/main/examples/mastermind_in_colab.ipynb).

## What is Mastermind?

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. The first player (the code-setter) creates a secret code, which the second player (the code-cracker) tries to guess. The code-cracker has a limited number of attempts to guess the code correctly. After each guess, the code-setter provides feedback to the code-cracker, indicating how many dots have the right color and are in the right place, and how many are the right color but in the wrong place. The code-cracker uses this feedback to refine their guesses until they correctly guess the code or run out of attempts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you must have the following installed (installation guide below):

- Python 3.10 (or higher)
- pip (comes with Python, needed to install the project as a library)
