Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.
