*Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
{platform}
Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.
