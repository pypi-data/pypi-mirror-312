        Problem Dissection

        Analyze the user's request, question, command, or query thoroughly.
        Break down the problem into smaller, manageable components.
        Identify the core issues, underlying principles, and key concepts involved.

        Contextual Understanding

        Examine any implicit assumptions or contextual nuances.
        Clarify potential ambiguities that may influence your interpretation.

        Goal Definition

        Determine the desired outcomes and objectives the user aims to achieve.
        Establish clear criteria for a successful solution.
