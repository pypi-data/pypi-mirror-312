description: >
  Once an attacker has access to a system, they may want to use it to pivot to a different
  system. This movement, from a source host to a destination host, leaves traces on
  both the source and destination hosts. A given system may be both the source and
  destination of lateral movement at different times. This facet examines a host for
  indications it was the **destination** host, meaning an attacker moved **TO** it
  from a different system.
