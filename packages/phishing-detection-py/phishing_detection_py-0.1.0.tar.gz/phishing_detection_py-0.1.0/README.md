# Phishing Detection Framework

## Overview
The Phishing Detection Framework provides an easy-to-use Python library for detecting phishing attempts in URLs and email messages. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models from Hugging Face to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

### Key Features
- Supports both URL and email phishing detection.
- Uses pre-trained models for high performance:
  - `bert-finetuned-phishing`
  - `phishing-email-detection-distilbert_v2.4.1`
- Batch processing for multiple inputs.
- Flexible API for customization and integration.
- Open-source and built for developers.

## Installation
Follow the steps outlined in the [Installation Documentation](docs/installation.md) to install the library and its dependencies.

## Usage
Refer to the [Usage Documentation](docs/usage.md) for examples and instructions on how to:
- Detect phishing in single URLs or emails.
- Process batches of URLs or emails.
- Customize the framework for your use case.

### Quick Start Example
```python
from phishing_detection import PhishingDetector

detector = PhishingDetector(model_type="url")
result = detector.predict("http://example-phishing-site.com")
print(result)
```
