# **PyFileMaster**

## *A Comprehensive File Handling Utility for Python*

## **About PyFileMaster**
PyFileMaster is an open-source Python package designed to simplify file handling tasks. Created by [Shubhashish Chakraborty](https://shubhlinks.vercel.app/), this package provides a set of powerful and easy-to-use methods for handling files, including reading, writing, and converting between formats such as binary (.dat), CSV (Excel), and text files.

With PyFileMaster, file operations become seamless. Simply provide the file path, and let the library handle the heavy lifting for you â€” no need for extra code or complex logic!

## **Features and Functionalities (As of ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyfilemaster))**

- **Write Binary Files (`writeBinFile`)**  
  It creates a Binary file containing Data which is being passed, *List of dictionaries to be stored in the file*:
  ```python
  import pyfilemaster as pfm

  pfm.writeBinFile("<path_name_of_your_binary_file>" , [
      {
          'name': 'Andrew',
          'language': 'python'
      },
      {
          'name': 'Tristan',
          'language': 'JavaScript'
      }
  ])

  ```

- **Read Binary Files (`readBinFile`)**  
  Effortlessly reads and prints the contents of a binary (.dat) file.
  ```python
  import pyfilemaster as pfm
  
  fileData = pfm.readBinFile("<path_to_your_binary_file>")
  
  print(fileData)
  ```

- **Convert Binary to CSV (`convertBinToCSV`)**  
  Converts data from a binary (.dat) file to a CSV (Excel) file in just one step.
  ```python
  import pyfilemaster as pfm

  pfm.convertBinToCSV("<path_to_your_binary_file>", "<name_of_the_generated_csv_file>")
  ```
