# Configuration

## Settings

The plugin must have a configuration, located at the top directory; it can be either:

- a YAML file named `.qgis-plugin-ci`
- an INI file named `setup.cfg` with a `[qgis-plugin-ci]` section
- a TOML file (= your actual `pyproject.toml` file) with a `[tool.qgis-plugin-ci]` section.

In the configuration, you should at least provide the following configuration:

- `plugin_path`, the folder where the source code is located under the git repository. See

You can find a template `.qgis-plugin-ci` in this repository.
You can read the docstring of the [Parameters module](/_apidoc/qgispluginci.parameters)
to know parameters which are available in the file.

## Conventions

QGIS-Plugin-CI is best served if you use these two conventions :

* [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
* [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)
