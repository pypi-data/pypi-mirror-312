## How to Use VLSTM

### 1. **Installation**
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Preparing Data**
Your dataset should be in a Pandas DataFrame (df) format with:

* Features: Columns containing historical data (e.g., 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close' for stock prices).
* Target: A column with the values you want to predict (e.g., 'Close' for stock price prediction).
Use the prepare_data() method to preprocess your data:

```bash
vlstm = VLSTM(target='Close') # target is mandatory, pass your target feature in string
X, y = vlstm.prepare_data(df, features = top_features) # top_features: column names (vlstm.prepare_data() is not mandatory, everything is automated on backend)
```

### 3. **Training the Model**
Once the data is ready, train the model using the train() method:

```bash
history, y_test, y_pred, train_score, test_score = vlstm.train(df, features = top_features) # top_features: column names
```

### 4. **Evaluating the Model**
After training, evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and MAD:

```bash
vlstm.evaluate(y_test, y_pred) # get various evaluation metrics
```

### 5. **Making Predictions**
To make predictions on new data:

```bash
predictions = vlstm.predict(new_df, features = top_features) # top_features: column names
```

### 6. **Visualizing Results**
You can visualize training loss and the actual vs predicted values:

```bash
vlstm.plot_loss(history)
vlstm.prediction_plot(y_test, y_pred)
```

## Model Architecture

The VLSTM architecture consists of two LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer and Dropout for regularization. The network is highly customizable to meet the needs of different datasets and tasks. Here's a breakdown of the model layers:

1. LSTM Layer 1: This is a customizable layer with a user-defined number of units.
2. LSTM Layer 2: Another LSTM layer that can capture more complex time-series dependencies.
3. Dense Layer: A fully connected layer with a customizable number of units.
4. Dropout: Regularization layer to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.
5. Output Layer: The final Dense layer with a customizable activation function (linear for regression tasks).
