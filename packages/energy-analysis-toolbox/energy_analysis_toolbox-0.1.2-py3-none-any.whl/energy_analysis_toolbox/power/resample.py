    The last step duration of the resampled series is set to the frequency ``freq``.

        Experimental: This function may change or be removed in a future release without
        warning.


    Parameters
    ----------
    series : pd.Series[float]
        a series of power.
    freq : str
        the frequency to resample to.
    origin : {"floor", "ceil", pd.Timestamp}, optional
        the origin of the resampling, by default None.
        See :py:func:`flow_rate_to_freq` for more details.
    last_step_duration : float, optional
        Duration of the last time-step in the ``volume`` series in (s).
        The default is |None| in which case the duration of the former-last
        time-step is used.
        See :py:func:`flow_rate_to_freq` for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series[float]
        the resampled power series.
