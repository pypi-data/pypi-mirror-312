    Class of exceptions raised when aTTN disentanglers are

    """


class QuantumGreenTeaSimulation(_ParameterizedClass):
    """
    Simulation class containing the model, the operators, the convergence
    settings, and the observables.

    **Arguments**

    model : instance of ``RydbergModel``
        Defines the model, e.g., the Hamiltonian of the system.

    operators : instance of ``TNOperators``
        Defines the operators used in the model and the observables.

    convergence : instance of ``TNConvergenceParameters``
        Specifies the convergence parameters for the simulation,
        for example the bond dimension.

    observables : instance of ``TNObservables``
        Defines the observables of the simulation. For details,
        check the corresponding class.

    folder_name_input : str, or callable; optional
        Specifies the folder where the input is stored. Will be created
        if not existing. Path can contain subfolders.
        default to ``input``

    folder_name_output : str, or callable; optional
        Specifies the folder where the output is stored. Will be created
        if not existing. Path can contain subfolders.
        default to ``output``

    tn_type : int, optional
        Specifies whether TTNs (1) or aTTNs (2) are used. The integer 0
        is reserved for running ED simulations within in the python
        frontend. LPTN can be called via (3) and an MPS via LPTN as (4).
        The python backends can be used with non-symmetric TTNs (5),
        non-symmetric MPS (6), or non-symmetric TTOs (8).
        Additionally, for aTTN python backend choose (7), but only correlation
        measurement and no groundstate search is so far implemented.
        default to 1

    tensor_backend : int, optional
        Choosing the underlying tensor, where the AbelianSymTensors are ``1``,
        and the Tensors are ``2``.
        default to 1

    mpo_mode : int, optional
        Choosing the MPO representation inside the simulation, where
        the value -1 enables an auto-selection.
        The other values are TPO via iTPO (0), iTPO (1), iTPO with
        update (2, for quenches), iTPO with compression (3), and sparse
        MPO (10, partially enabled), indexed sparse MPO (11, partially enabled)
        Default to -1.

    disentangler : None or np.ndarray, optional
        If the aTTN is used, the disentangler positions can be passed
        as a 2d numpy array with 2 rows and n columns, where n is the
        number of disentanglers. The indices must be passed as python
        indices starting from 0 in the mapped 1d system. The other option is
        to set it to None, in that case the disentangler positions are automatically
        selected if the tensor network is aTTN.
        Default to None.

    disentangler_file : str, optional
        If disentanglers are present, their positions are passed
        to fortran via this file. It will be located inside the
        input folder.
        default to ``disentangler.dat``

    has_log_file : bool, optional
        Flag if log file should be created instead of writing
        the output to standard out. If False, all output will
        go to standard out.
        Default to False (no log file)

    store_checkpoints : bool, optional
        If True, the state will be written to a file after each
        sweep in the ground state search and after each time step
        in a time evolution. Ground state searches have the option
        to write checkpoints also after each tensor optimization,
        which the algorithm can decide on without control by the
        user.
        If `True`, `delete_existing_folder` must be `False`.
        Default to True

    verbosity : int, optional, deprecated
        This parameter used to set the output verbosity of python functions.
        It is now ignored and deprecated in favor of :py:func:`logging.setLevel`.
        Default to 0.

    qgreentea_exe : str, optional
        Set name of the executable to be used for calls to
        quantum green tea. Allows to customize beyond executables
        in the local folder.
        Default to `./MainaTTN`

    py_tensor_backend : :class:`TensorBackend`
        Setup for tensor backend in python. Has to match simulation
        configuration when running with python, e.g., the integer
        `tensor_backend`. No meaning for fortrans simulations.

    **Reserved keywords of the simulation dictionary**

    The following keywords cannot be used for adapting simulations to the
    needs by the user, but have a predefined meaning. Additional predefined
    keywords may be imported, e.g., when using a specific model or a specific
    set of operators.

    * `continue_file` : load file at the beginning of the simulation.
    * `use_mpo_from_continue_file` : bool (Python only). Use MPO stored
      in continue file.
    * `seed` : seed for random number generators.
    * `magic_number` : for debugging / developing to pass something to
       fortran.
    * `SymmetrySector`
    * `SymmetryGenerators`
    * `SymmetryTypes`
    * `Quenches`
    * `ed_sparse` : bool, use in exact state emulator to
      switch between sparse and dense Hamiltonian.
    * `sweep_order` : defines the sweep order for the statics (python only)
    * `exclude_from_hash` : dictionary entries that will be excluded from hash.

    **Details**

    1) Checkpoints vs continue files: checkpointing is used to restart the same
       simulation. Continue files can be used to set the input state across
       simulations, but the simulation will start always at the beginning with
       this user-provided input state.
    2) Hashing: hashes are generated to identify that a simulation setup did
       not change. For example, changes in a simulation which uses checkpoints
       can be detected this way.
