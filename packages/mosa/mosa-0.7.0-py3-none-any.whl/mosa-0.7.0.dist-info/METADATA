# Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA)

Simulated Annealing (SA) has been initially proposed in [*Optimization by Simulated Annealing*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.220.4598.671) as an optimization heuristic. Multi-objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) extends the original, single-objective SA to approximate the Pareto front in multi-objective optimization problems. A comprehensive discussion on MOSA and its algorithm variants can be found in [*Multi-objective Simulated Annealing: Principles and Algorithm Variants*](https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/8134674).

This library implements the MOSA algorithm in Python. Jupyter notebooks in the *examples* directory provide usage examples.

The easiest way to install MOSA is using **pip**:

```
pip install mosa
```
