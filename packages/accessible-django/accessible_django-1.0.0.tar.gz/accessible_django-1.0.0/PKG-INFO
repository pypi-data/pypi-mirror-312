# AccessibleDjango üåü  
**Python 3.10+** | **License: MIT** | **Version: 0.0.1**  

AccessibleDjango is a Django package focused on checking your web applications for accessibility compliance. It ensures your app adheres to accessibility standards, making your web interfaces usable for everyone, including individuals with disabilities. AccessibleDjango currently checks for missing or empty `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags, with plans for further accessibility features in future releases.

---

## üåü Features  

- **Accessibility Checks**:  
  Automatically evaluates views and templates for common accessibility issues, such as missing or empty `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags.  

- **Detailed Reports**:  
  Generates comprehensive accessibility reports highlighting issues found in your templates and views.  

- **Developer-Friendly Tools**:  
  Easily integrate AccessibleDjango into your project and CI pipelines.  

- **Customizable Rules**:  
  Tailor the accessibility checks to suit your application‚Äôs needs, including enabling/disabling checks for specific issues.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes  

AccessibleDjango currently focuses exclusively on checking `alt` attributes for `<img>` tags. Future releases may include features such as:  
- Prebuilt accessible templates.  
- Enhanced form generation tools.  
- Real-time accessibility validation in the development environment.

## üöÄ Quick Start  

### Installation  

To install AccessibleDjango, run:  
```bash  
pip install accessible-django  
```  

### Basic Usage  

#### Add to Installed Apps  
In your `settings.py`, add `'accessible_django'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:  
```python  
INSTALLED_APPS = [  
    ...,  
    'accessible_django',  
]

## üìñ Documentation  

### Running Checks  

```bash
python manage.py check --deploy
```


## üöß Limitations  

- AccessibleDjango currently focuses only on identifying accessibility issues related to `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags.  
- It does not yet provide prebuilt accessible templates, form enhancements, or real-time validation in development.  
- Manual testing may be required for third-party components.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap  

We are actively working to expand AccessibleDjango to include additional accessibility features. Future releases may include:  

1. **Prebuilt Accessible Templates**: Ready-to-use templates that adhere to WCAG 2.1 standards.  
2. **Enhanced Form Generation Tools**: Tools for generating accessible forms and validating form input accessibility.  
3. **Real-Time Accessibility Validation**: A live testing mode to validate accessibility as you develop.  
4. **Comprehensive Accessibility Checks**: Full support for various accessibility issues, such as ARIA roles, color contrast, form validation, and more.
