## Description
This repository implements calculations for four-element power matching LC-baluns.
These four-element networks provide common-mode rejection in addition to power matching for arbitrary complex impedances at the design frequency.

A web version of this calculator with similar functionality is available at [https://rftoolbox.dtu.dk/rfcalc/LCBalun.html](https://rftoolbox.dtu.dk/rfcalc/LCBalun.html).

## Installation
To install the Python package (required for using the Jupyter notebook), run `python3 -m pip install lc-power-match-baluns`.
Alternatively, run `pip install .` in the root directory of this repository.

To use the Jupyter notebook, the requirements at [https://lcapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](https://lcapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) must also be installed.

## Usage
This repository can be used interactively through the `lc_power_match_baluns.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

This repository also implements a Python package `lc_power_match_baluns`, which can be used to interact with the baluns programmatically.

## Derivations
Notebooks relating to the derivation procedure for the baluns are located in the `derivations` directory.

## Experiment
Data and notebooks relating to the experimental verification of the baluns are located in the `experiment` directory.

## Authors and acknowledgment
This repository was created by Rasmus Jepsen for the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) to supplement the research article "Four-Element LC-Baluns for Power Matching Arbitrary Impedances" by Rasmus Jepsen, Jan Henrik Ardenkjær-Larsen, and Vitaliy Zhurbenko (submitted).

This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 856432).
