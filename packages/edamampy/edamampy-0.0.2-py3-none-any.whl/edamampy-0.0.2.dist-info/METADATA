# edamampy

This project is a library which wraps the Edamam Rest API and provides validation.

## Caution
!!! This is the very first version of this package. There is until now only the code in here for the recipe search api.
In the future I plan on extending the SDK or maybe just leave it at the one api provided by Edamam. !!!
Under active development and breaking changes WILL most likely happen.

## Overview
This project was created by me to make interacting with the Edamam Recipe Search Rest API easier. I wanted to build an app which is
using Edamams vast DB, but the API was cumbersome to work with. Hence, I developed this little library.
It has everything you need to make validated requests to the Recipe Search API provided by Edamam. 
So that in valid queries don't even reach the API don't hit your API quota and make your life easier.
Validation also makes error handling much easier.

## Installation
To install this project, run the following command:
```bash
pip install edamampy
```

# Usage
```
from edamampy import EdamamAPIHandler
from edamampy import ApiSettings

settings = ApiSettings()

handler = EdamamAPIHandler(settings)

for recipes in handler:
    print(recipes.model_dump())

```
Each for loop iteration is one part of the paiginated api response.
