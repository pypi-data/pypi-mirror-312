Note: Press f1 to end the recording/playback and f2 to pause/resume it (both keys configurable as function paramater or cli option).

# this plays the recorded events and collects the played events
played_events = list(play(recording, loops=3))

```python
help(record)
help(play)

python -m botable record > ./recorded_events.py
cat ./recorded_events.py | python -m botable play --playback-loops 3 > ./played_events.py
```
