# NOB VISUAL

Visualization of nested objects.
The main output is a circular packing in Tkinter with an "hover interaction".
By hovering over the circles, the user can peek at the content.

![example](https://cerfacs.fr/coop/images/nobvisual/nobvisual.png)

*Example of nobvisual on a folder structure. Three subfolders show a similar content. Yellow circles are binary files, blue are ASCII files*.

This last example is for a nested object build on a folder structure, but nob visual output can be run on various nested objects, particularly or JSON or YAML contents.

See the full [online documentation](https://nobvisual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on ReadTheDocs.
