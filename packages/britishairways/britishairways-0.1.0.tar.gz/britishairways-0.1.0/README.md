## Features

- Fetch the **specific round-trip flight price** for given departure and return dates.
- Fetch the **specific one-way flight price** for a given date.
- Fetch the **cheapest round-trip flights** for a region and origin airport.
- Retrieve **monthly pricing data** for a specific route and trip length.
- Fetch **calendar-based pricing data** for specific months, showing daily flight prices.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the package using pip:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd british-airways-py
pip install .
```

---

## Functions

### 1. `get_one_way_price`

Fetch the price for a one-way flight on a specific date.

#### Parameters:
- `origin` (str): The origin airport code (e.g., "LHR").
- `destination` (str): The destination airport code (e.g., "JFK").
- `departure_date` (str): The departure date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

#### Example Usage:
```python
from britishairways.api import BritishAirways

# Initialize the client
ba = BritishAirways()

# Get a one-way flight price
one_way_flight = ba.get_one_way_price(
    origin="LON",
    destination="NYC",
    departure_date="2024-12-15"
)
print(one_way_flight)
```

Please note that sometimes this does not work with an IATA airport code. If there is a group of airports in a city, you should use that code for example LON will work but LHR will not work.

#### Example Output:
```json
[
    {
        "outbound_date": "2024-12-15T00:00:00Z",
        "price": 700,
        "cabin": "M"
    }
]
```

- `departure_date` (str): The departure date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `return_date` (str): The return date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

    origin="LON",
    destination="NYC",
    departure_date="2024-12-15",
    return_date="2024-12-22"
)
print(flights)
```
