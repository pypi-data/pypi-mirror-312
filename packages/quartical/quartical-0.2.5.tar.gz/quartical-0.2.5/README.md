# QuartiCal

QuartiCal is the successor to CubiCal. It implements a suite of fast radio interferometric calibration routines exploiting complex optimisation. Unlike CubiCal, QuartiCal allows for any available Jones terms to be combined. It can also be deployed on a cluster (documentation under construction).

## Installation

QuartiCal can be installed using pip: `pip install quartical`.

## Documentation

Documentation is available on [readthedocs](http://quartical.readthedocs.io).

## Public Beta

QuartiCal is now in public beta! That means we want you to use (and break) it as much as possible. Any bugs and feature requests can be submitted via the issue tracker.
