        error_message (Union[None, Unset, str]): If non-null then provides a warning or error message that was raised by
            Igloo Cloud when the run was calculated.
        link (Union[None, Unset, str]): Provides a Url to use to view the job on Igloo Cloud.
        state (Union[Unset, JobState]): The state of a Job. This can be one of the following values:
             * InProgress - The job is currently being calculated.
             * Completed - The job has finished calculating and the results are ready to be viewed.
             * Warned - The job has finished calculating and the results are ready to be viewed, however the model emitted a
            warning message.
             * Error - The job has finished calculating, however the model calculation terminated early due to an error.
