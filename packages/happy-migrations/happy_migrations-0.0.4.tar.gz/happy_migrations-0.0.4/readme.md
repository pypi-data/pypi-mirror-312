# Happy Migrations: Smooth Transitions, Zero Tears (WIP)

Happy is a developer-friendly database schema migration CLI and library. Write your migrations as simple Python scripts with raw SQL, and let Happy handle the heavy lifting. No fuss, no stress—just clean, controlled database changes directly from your code.

## Database support 🔋
Currently, SQLite is supported. More DBs coming soon!
