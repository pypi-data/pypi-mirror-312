The y-direction wind force is a percentage of the x-direction force, considering the type of bridge and lack of dynamic load from traffic. In the z-direction, the forces account for both upward and downward actions (lift), emphasizing the changes due to no traffic load. Each calculation must consider factors such as deck geometry, wind exposure, and structural configuration to ensure the bridge’s stability under various wind conditions without the influence of traffic.",

        "description": "[HK.SDM-2013] This guide explains how to calculate the uniform bridge temperature range components specific to Hong Kong, where the contraction range, expansion range, and overall range for the uniform bridge temperature are adjusted based on climate data and environmental conditions unique to Hong Kong. The minimum and maximum uniform bridge temperatures have been updated to account for climate change impacts in Hong Kong, ensuring that structural temperature ranges accurately reflect local conditions and capture the potential contraction, expansion, and overall variation of bridge temperatures within these localized parameters.",
