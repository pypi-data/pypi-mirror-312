# Documentation
The documentation can be found [here](https://scudd-bbatardiere-23a95a6bd5720b66bd736860e2832d806d81c0db1a9b5.pages.mia.inra.fr/).


# CONTRIBUTING
You should run
```pre-commit install```
in the repo directory before commiting (if ```pre-commit``` is not installed,
you can pip install it). This will make sure each python file is well
formated and pylint will check the code before any python file is committed. You can check the ```.pre-commit-config.yaml``` file for more details on pylint configuration.
