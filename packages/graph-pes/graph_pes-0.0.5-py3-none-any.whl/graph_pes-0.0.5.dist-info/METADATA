`graph-pes` is a framework built to accelerate the development of machine-learned potential energy surface (PES) models that act on graph representations of atomic structures.

## Features

- Experiment with new model architectures by inheriting from our `GraphPESModel` base class.
- Train your own or existing models (e.g., SchNet, NequIP, PaiNN, MACE, etc.).
- Easily configure distributed training, learning rate scheduling, weights and biases logging, and other features using our `graph-pes-train` command line interface.
- Use our data-loading pipeline within your own training loop.
- Run molecular dynamics simulations via LAMMPS (or ASE) using any `GraphPESModel` and the `pair_style graph_pes` LAMMPS command.

## Quickstart

For a 0-install quickstart experience, please see [this Google colab](TODO), which you can also find in our documentation.

Want to try this out locally? Run the following commands:

```bash
# optionally create a new environment
conda create -n graph-pes python=3.10
conda activate graph-pes

# install graph-pes
pip install graph-pes

# download a config file
wget https://tinyurl.com/graph-pes-qm7-quickstart

# train a model
graph-pes-train qm7-quickstart.yaml
```



## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jla-gardner/graph-pes).
