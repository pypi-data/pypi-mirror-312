## Usage

### Initialize the Client

To use the package, initialize the `VirginAtlantic` client:

```python
from virginatlantic.api import VirginAtlantic

# Initialize the client
client = VirginAtlantic()
```

---

### Fetch Flight Prices

#### **Basic Example**
Retrieve flight prices for a specific route and travel class:

```python
flights = client.get_flight_prices(
    origin="LHR",  # London Heathrow
    destination="JFK",  # New York JFK
    travel_class="ECONOMY",  # Travel class
    sorting="PRICE_ASC",  # Sort by price (low to high)
    page_number=1,  # First page
    limit=10  # Number of results per page
)

# Display results
for flight in flights:
    print(
        f"From {flight['origin']} to {flight['destination']}: "
        f"{flight['price']} ({flight['departure_date']} to {flight['return_date']}, {flight['travel_class']})"
    )
```

#### **Output**
```
From London to New York: $450 (2024-12-15 to 2024-12-22, Economy)
From London to New York: $470 (2024-12-16 to 2024-12-23, Economy)
```

---

### Optional Parameters

You can omit the `origin` or `destination` to fetch all flights departing from or arriving at any location:

```python
# Flights from any origin to JFK
flights = client.get_flight_prices(destination="JFK", travel_class="PREMIUM")
```

---

### Advanced Sorting

Sort results using any of the following options:
- **`POPULAR`**: By popularity.
- **`DEPARTURE_DATE_ASC`**: Departure date (earliest to latest).
- **`DEPARTURE_DATE_DESC`**: Departure date (latest to earliest).
- **`PRICE_ASC`**: Price (low to high).
- **`PRICE_DESC`**: Price (high to low).

```python
# Sort by departure date (latest to earliest)
flights = client.get_flight_prices(
    origin="LHR", destination="JFK", travel_class="UPPER CLASS", sorting="DEPARTURE_DATE_DESC"
)
```

---

## Error Handling

The package raises appropriate errors for invalid inputs:

- **Invalid Travel Class**: Raises a `ValueError` if the travel class is not `ECONOMY`, `PREMIUM`, or `UPPER CLASS`.
- **Invalid Sorting Option**: Raises a `ValueError` for unrecognized sorting methods.
- **API Errors**: Raises an `APIError` for network or server-side issues.

Example:
```python
try:
    flights = client.get_flight_prices("LHR", "JFK", "INVALID_CLASS")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

    for flight in flights:
        print(
            f"From {flight['origin']} to {flight['destination']}: "
