# 🧠 BIDS Apps CLI 🚀

Manage and run your **BIDS apps** with ease! This tool is designed to streamline running multiple BIDS apps on your BIDS datasets, 
whether the apps are containerized BIDS apps, or SnakeBIDS apps that use containers for different rules of the workflow. 

### ✨ Features:
- 📂 **Organize and manage** your BIDS apps configuration with a central repository.
- 🏃 **Run BIDS apps** seamlessly from the command line, passing custom arguments.
- 🖥️ **SnakeBIDS batching** runs any BIDS App using a snakemake/snakebids wrapper with parallelization. 
- 📦 **Zip outputs** and run in isolated temp directories for HPC systems, including smart merging of participant zipfiles.
- 🔍 **Discover new apps** from the [BIDS Apps Registry](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/).
