The bidding_manager.py library is a key component of the application that manages all bidding-related functionalities for the property management system. It provides seamless integration with AWS DynamoDB to handle essential operations such as placing bids, retrieving all bids for a property, determining the highest bid, and accepting bids for properties.

Key Features:

	•	Placing Bids: Ensures buyers can place valid bids that are higher than the current highest bid for a property.
	•	Fetching Bids: Retrieves all bids associated with a property and sorts them in descending order based on bid amount.
	•	Determining the Highest Bid: Quickly identifies the highest bid placed on a property for validation and display purposes.
	•	Accepting Bids: Allows sellers to accept a specific bid, marking the bid as “accepted” and updating the associated property’s status to “sold.”
	•	Efficient Data Handling: Utilizes DynamoDB to store and query bid and property data efficiently, ensuring scalability and reliability.
