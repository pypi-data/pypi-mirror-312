# How this package was built for PyPI

- installing 'build' and 'twine' via pip

    `python3 -m pip install --upgrade build`
    `python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine`

- getting an API token from PyPI and placing in ~/.pypirc

- in top-level (where pyptoject.toml resides) `python -m build`
 
  This creates package files in the dists/ subdirectory

- upload
 testpypi: `python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* `
 live pypi: `python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/* `
