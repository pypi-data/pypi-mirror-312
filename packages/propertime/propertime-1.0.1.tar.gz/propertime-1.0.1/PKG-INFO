Propertime is an attempt to implement proper time management in Python. Its approach
is to fully embrace the extra complexity arising due to the intrinsic need of conflating
together physical and calendar time, instead of oversimplifying or dismissing it.

In a nutshell, it provides two main classes: the ``Time`` class for representing
time (similar to a datetime) and the ``TimeSpan`` class for representing units
of time (similar to a timedelta). Such classes play nice with Python datetimes so
that you can mix and match and use them only when needed.

You can have a look at the [README](https://github.com/sarusso/Propertime/blob/main/README.md)
for a better introduction together with some usage examples, and you can get started by having
a look at the [quickstart notebook](https://github.com/sarusso/Propertime/blob/main/Quickstart.ipynb)
or by reading the [reference documentation](https://propertime.readthedocs.io).
