thorlabs_elliptec
=================

This is a python interface to Thorlabs Elliptec series of piezoelectric motion stages and mounts. It
should support all models including:

- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL6 SM1 threaded dual-position slider
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL7 linear stage
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL8 rotation stage
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL9 SM1 threaded four-position slider
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL10 linear stage
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL12 SM05 threaded six-position slider
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL14 SM1 threaded rotation mount
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL17 28 mm travel linear stage
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL18 rotation stage
- Thorlabs Elliptec ELL20 60 mm travel linear stage

As of version 1.0, all basic functionality is implemented. Version 1.2 introduces the "multi-drop"
capability which allow multiple devices to share a single serial port device. Note however that only
a single device can be moved at a time due to a limitation with the communications protocol. If
multiple devices must be moved simultaneously, each device must be connected via its own serial port
(such as a dedicated USB to serial adaptor).
