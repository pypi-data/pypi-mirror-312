===========

Design

.. _Callbacks:

Callbacks
"""""""""

All the LibPulse async methods ultimately call either ``_pa_get()`` or
``_pa_get_list()``. Both coroutines follow the same schema:

  - define an embedded function as the callback
  - create the ctypes function pointer for this callback
  - create a future
  - call the ``pulse`` async function and wait on the future that will be set
    by the callback when done.
  - return the result

*So what happens when two asyncio tasks running concurrently are both waiting on
their own future for the completion of the same callback ?*

The answer is that there is no concurrency issue:

    ``ctypes`` creates each ctypes function pointer for the callback by calling
    `PyCFuncPtr_new()`_ which in turn calls `_ctypes_alloc_callback()`_. This
    last function uses ``libffi`` to allocate a closure (quoting the ``libffi``
    documentation [#]_: ``closures work by assembling a tiny function at
    runtime``). So each one of the two callbacks is allocated its own closure
    and gets a different function pointer.

Requirements
------------

Development:
    * GNU ``gcc`` and `pyclibrary`_ are used to parse the libpulse headers and
      create the ``pulse_types``, ``pulse_enums``, ``pulse_structs``
      and ``pulse_functions`` modules of the libpulse package.

      To re-create those modules using the current libpulse headers run [#]_::

        $ python -m tools.libpulse_parser libpulse

    * `coverage`_ is used to get the test suite coverage.
    * `flit`_ is used to publish libpulse to PyPi and may be used to install
      libpulse locally.

      At the root of the libpulse git repository, use the following command to
      install libpulse locally::

        $ flit install --symlink [--python path/to/python]

      This symlinks libpulse into site-packages rather than copying it, so that
      you can test changes.

Documentation:
    * `Sphinx`_ [#]_.
    * `Read the Docs theme`_.

Documentation
-------------

To build locally the documentation follow these steps:

  - Fetch the GitLab test coverage badge::

      $ curl -o docs/source/_static/coverage.svg "https://gitlab.com/xdegaye/libpulse/badges/master/coverage.svg?min_medium=85&min_acceptable=90&min_good=90"

  - Build the html documentation and the man pages::

      $ make -C docs clean html

Updating the development version
--------------------------------

In order to update the version at the `latest documentation`_ during
development, after a change in the functionality or in the features, run the
following commands::

    $ python -m tools.set_devpt_version_name
    $ make -C docs clean html
    $ git commit -m "Update version"
    $ git push

Releasing
---------

* Run the test suite from the root of the project [#]_::

    $ python -m unittest --verbose --catch --failfast

* Get the test suite coverage::

    $ coverage run --include="./*" -m unittest
    $ coverage report -m

* Update ``__version__`` in libpulse/__init__.py.
* Update docs/source/history.rst if needed.
* Build locally the documentation, see the previous section.
* Commit the changes::

    $ git commit -m 'Version 0.n'
    $ git push

* Tag the release and push::

    $ git tag -a 0.n -m 'Version 0.n'
    $ git push --tags

* Publish the new version to PyPi::

    $ flit publish
