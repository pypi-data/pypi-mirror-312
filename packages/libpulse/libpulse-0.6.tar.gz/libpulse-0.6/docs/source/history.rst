Release history
===============

Version 0.6
  - The ``pactl-py`` command runs the pactl Python module. It is created by the
    libpulse installation process (issue #1).


Version 0.5
  - libpulse versioning conforms to PEP 440.
  - The LibPulse methods listed by LibPulse.context_list_methods and whose name
    ends with ``_info`` or ``_formats`` return now a single element instead of a
    list with one element.

Version 0.4
  - Rename LibPulse.get_events() to get_events_iterator().
  - Replace the *Interface* section by *Libpulse API* in the documentation.
  - Add the CtypesPulseStructure subclasses Pa_buffer_attr, Pa_channel_map,
    Pa_cvolume, Pa_format_info and Pa_sample_spec. These classes are used to
    build ctypes ``Structure`` instances and pass their pointer to some of
    the pulse functions.
  - Add the static coroutine ``LibPulse.get_current_instance()``.

Version 0.3
  - The ``pactl`` module is a Python implementation of the ``pactl`` command
    that runs both on Pulseaudio and Pipewire.
  - ``server`` and ``flags`` are optional arguments of the LibPulse constructor
    used by pa_context_connect() when connecting to the server.
  - Exceptions in callbacks and asyncio tasks are propagated to the async
    methods.
  - Use ``pa_strerror()`` to log errors.
  - Drain the pulse context before disconnecting.

Version 0.2
  - Add the ``pa_context_subscribe.py`` example.
  - Add the ``pa_context_load_module.py`` example.
  - Unreference stream pointer upon exit in ``pa_stream_new.py`` example.
  - Raise ``LibPulseArgumentError`` when args do not match the signature.
  - Document callback concurrent access.
  - ``stream_success_methods`` require a ``pa_stream *`` ctypes pointer as first
    argument.

Version 0.1
  - Publish the project on PyPi.
  - Raise an exception upon instantiation of more than one LibPulse instance.
