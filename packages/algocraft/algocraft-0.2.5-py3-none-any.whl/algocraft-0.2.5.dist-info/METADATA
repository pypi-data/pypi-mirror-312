# Algocraft

**Algocraft** is a Python package that provides efficient and easy-to-use implementations of classic algorithms, including searching, sorting, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more. Designed to be a comprehensive library, **Algocraft** offers a wide range of fundamental algorithms commonly used in computer science, making it a go-to toolkit for both learning and practical applications.

## Features

### **Sorting Algorithms**
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Strassen's Matrix Multiplication

### **Search Algorithms**
- Binary Search
- Linear Search

### **Dynamic Programming**
- Fibonacci Sequence
- Knapsack Problem

### **Graph Algorithms**
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

### **Miscellaneous Algorithms**
- Topological Sort
- Tower of Hanoi
- 8-Queens Problem
- Simplex Method

## Installation

You can install the `algocraft` package via `pip` from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

```bash
pip install algocraft
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the algorithms directly by importing them. For example:

```python
from algocraft import binary_search, fibonacci, merge_sort

# Binary Search
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
index = binary_search(arr, 3)
print(f'Index of 3: {index}')  # Output: 2

# Fibonacci
fib_number = fibonacci(10)
print(f'10th Fibonacci number: {fib_number}')  # Output: 34

# Merge Sort
arr_to_sort = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr_to_sort)
print(f'Sorted array: {sorted_arr}')  # Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
```
