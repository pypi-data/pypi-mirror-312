python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
```

### Light

```
dtparam=spi=on
enable_uart=1
```

Reboot the Raspberry Pi via terminal

```
sudo reboot
```

## Installation

```
pip3 install wiggle-camera
```

## CLI

```
wiggle-camera -h
```

## Installation for development

Updating packages on Raspberry Pi

pip3 install -e .
```

For installation without dev dependencies
```
pip install --no-dev -r requirements.txt

## Publishing to PyPi

To build your package, you'll need to install the `build` module. You can do this with pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade build
```

Then, you can build your package with the following command:

```bash
python -m build
```

To publish your package to PyPI, you'll need to install the `twine` module:

```bash
pip install --upgrade twine
```

Then, you can use `twine` to upload your distributions to PyPI:

```bash
twine upload -u __token__ -p your_token_here dist/*
```
