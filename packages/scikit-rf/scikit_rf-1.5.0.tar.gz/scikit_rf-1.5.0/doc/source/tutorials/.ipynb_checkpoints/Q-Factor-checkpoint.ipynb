    "# Quality Factors\n",
    "## Resonant Circuits and Q-factor\n",
    "Resonant circuits are used extensively in oscillators, tuned amplifiers, filters, etc. At a particular frequency, _a resonant frequency_ $f_r$ (or $\\omega_r$), resonators presents a maximum (or a minimum) impedance (ex: open or short circuit)[1]. The quality factor $Q$, or Q-factor, is a unitless figure of merit of the losses of a resonant passive circuit, defined as [2,3]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q = 2 \\pi \\left. \\frac{\\textrm{Average Energy Stored}}{\\textrm{Energy Loss per Second}} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_r}\n",
    "=\n",
    "\\omega_r \\left. \\frac{\\textrm{Average Energy Stored}}{\\textrm{Average Power Loss}} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_r}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this definition, lower loss implies a higher $Q$. Resonators having higher Q-factors resonate with greater amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) but have a smaller range of frequencies $BW$ around that frequency for which they resonate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loaded of Unloaded Q-factors\n",
    "Actually, there are three Q factors than can be defined depending upon which loss is being considered [2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unloaded Q: $$Q_0 = \\omega_r \\left. \\frac{\\textrm{Energy Stored in the Resonant Circuit}}{\\textrm{Power Loss in the Resonant Circuit}} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* External Q: $$Q_e = \\omega_r \\left. \\frac{\\textrm{Energy Stored in the Resonant Circuit}}{\\textrm{Power Loss in the External Circuit}} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loaded Q: $$Q_L = \\omega_r \\left. \\frac{\\textrm{Energy Stored in the Resonant Circuit}}{\\textrm{Total Power Loss}} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The _loaded_ Q-factor $Q_L$, describes energy dissipation within the entire resonant system comprising of the resonator itself and the instrument used for observing resonances [3]. The term _loading_ refers to the effect that the external circuit has on measured quantities. Any loss mechanisms due to the external circuitry will have the effect of lowering the $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The _unloaded_ Q-factor $Q_0$ is a characteristic of the resonator itself, in the absence of any loading effects caused by external circuitry (uncoupled). For most applications, the quantity that is desired is the unloaded Q-factor $Q_0$ which is determined by energy dissipation associated with the resonator only and therefore gives the best description of the resonant mode. Direct measurement of the unloaded Q of a resonator is generally not possible because of the loading effect of the measurement system. However, it is possible to estimate $Q_0$ from measurements of the frequency response of the loaded resonator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy dissipation in the external circuit is characterized by the _external_ Q-factor $Q_e$ and these three Q-factors are related by the relationship (deduced from the three expressions above):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{Q_L} = \\frac{1}{Q_e} + \\frac{1}{Q_0} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If one defines the _coupling factor_ $\\beta=Q_0/Q_e$ then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q_0 = (1 + \\beta) Q_L\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Three cases can be distinguished:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\beta<1$: The resonator is said to be _undercoupled_ to the feeding circuitry\n",
    "2. $\\beta=1$: The resonator is said to be _critically coupled_\n",
    "3. $\\beta>1$: The resonator is said to be _overcoupled_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the measurements of the loaded Quality factor $Q_L$ is straightforward, obtaining uncertainty below 1% (which is considered to be low for Q-factor measurement) requires attention to several aspects of the experimental procedure. In addition, finding the unloaded $Q_0$ from measured S-parameters consists in first finding the coupling factor $\\beta$, then measure $Q_L$ from the 3dB bandwidth and using the relationships above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, `scikit-rf` implements automatic methods for determining _loaded_ and _unloaded_ Q-factors from frequency-domain S-parameters. The implemented methods are described in detail in [4], and can be applied to measurements of transmission or reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example with a Parallel RLC Circuit\n",
    "To illustrate the usage of the `Qfactor` class of `scikit-rf`, a parallel RLC circuit as illustrated above is used as an canonical example for which analytical formulas are available for benchmarking.\n",
