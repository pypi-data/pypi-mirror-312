# Advanced Metaprogramming in `managers` Module

## Overview

This module is a crucial part of the `weberist` project, providing a streamlined management system for different web drivers, including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge. It offers a centralized interface for accessing and configuring web drivers, options, services, and managers. This simplifies the process of setting up and using web drivers for automated testing, web scraping, or other automation tasks.

## Metaprogramming in Action

Metaprogramming allows programs to manipulate themselves or other programs with greater flexibility. This module employs metaprogramming techniques extensively to achieve high adaptability and reduce boilerplate code.

### 1. Dynamic Attribute Access

One of the key metaprogramming techniques used in this module is dynamic attribute access through `getattr`. The `WebDrivers` class encapsulates the logic to handle multiple web drivers, each with its own set of options, services, and managers. Instead of hard-coding the logic for each browser, dynamic attribute access is employed to retrieve the appropriate components based on the browser name:

```python
options_class = getattr(self, f\"{browser_name}_options\")
service_class = getattr(self, f\"{browser_name}_service\")
manager = getattr(self, f\"{browser_name}_manager\")
```

This approach allows the get method to flexibly handle any supported browser without duplicating code for each specific case. If a new browser needs to be supported, you only need to define the name of the browser in the construction of the object.

### 2. Dynamic Method Invocation

In addition to dynamic attribute access, the module also leverages dynamic method invocation. For example, when adding arguments or experimental options to a web driver's options, the add_option method dynamically calls methods on the options

```python
getattr(option, 'add_argument')(argument)
```

This allows the module to add options or experimental features to the web driver's configuration in a flexible manner, handling differences between browsers gracefully.

### 3. Configurable Capabilities

The module also supports dynamic configuration of capabilities for remote web drivers. Depending on whether the web driver is intended to run locally or remotely (e.g., in a Selenium Grid), different capabilities are set dynamically:

```python
if 'remote' in browser:
    capabilities.update(SELENOID_CAPABILITIES)
```

This approach ensures that the web drivers are configured correctly for different execution environments without requiring separate methods or classes.

### 4. Flexible Browser Support

The module's design allows it to be extended easily to support additional browsers in the future. By using metaprogramming techniques, such as dynamically retrieving and invoking attributes and methods, the module minimizes the need for changes when new browsers or features are added.

### 5. Encapsulation and Abstraction

The module encapsulates the complexity of web driver configuration and usage behind a simple interface. Users can retrieve fully-configured web drivers with a single call to the get method, without needing to understand the underlying implementation details. This abstraction is made possible through the use of metaprogramming, which keeps the interface clean and intuitive while providing powerful customization options under the hood.
