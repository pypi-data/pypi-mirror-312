`multidms` is a Python package written by the 
[Matsen group](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/)
in collaboration with 
[William DeWitt](https://wsdewitt.github.io/)
and the
[Bloom Lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html).
It can be used to jointly fit a global-epistasis model to one or more deep mutational scanning experiments, 
with the goal of estimating the effects of individual mutations, 
and how much the effects differ between experiments.

The source code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/matsengrp/multidms).

Please see the [Documentation](https://matsengrp.github.io/multidms/) for details on installation and usage.
