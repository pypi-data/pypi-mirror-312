# jax-cgd

A simple and memory-efficient implementation of competitive gradient descent (CGD) and its adaptive version (ACGD) using JAX. The cgd algorithm was originally proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12103), with its adaptive version introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05852). This repository implements both algorithms in an efficient and flexible manner using JAX, a powerful library for high-performance machine learning.

You can install this package with `pip`:

```
pip install jax-cgd
```
