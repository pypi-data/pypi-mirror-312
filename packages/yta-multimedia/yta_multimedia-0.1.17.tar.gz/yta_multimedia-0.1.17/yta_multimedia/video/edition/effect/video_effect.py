    A video effect is an effect that is customly made by using 
    personal modifications, calculations, involving maybe some
    image manipulation, etc.

    A moviepy effect (or what I call like that) is an effect that is
    applied directly to the video by using only the moviepy editor
    and/or moviepy vfx module. It could be a simple moviepy effect
    made an object to simplify the work with it, or a more complex
    effect that is build with some different small effects.
