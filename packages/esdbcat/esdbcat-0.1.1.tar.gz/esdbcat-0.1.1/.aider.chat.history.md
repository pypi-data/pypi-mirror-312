#### Hi, after a bug report I've reproduced that the official esdbclient does not work with protobuf 3.12.4, I think we need at least protobuf 5. Can you add that as a requirement even though we don't need it directly ourselves, please?  

I'll add protobuf>=5.0.0 as a dependency in pyproject.toml since it's required for esdbclient to work properly.

pyproject.toml
<source>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
dependencies = [
    "click>=8.0.0",
    "esdbclient>=0.4.0"
]
=======
dependencies = [
    "click>=8.0.0",
    "esdbclient>=0.4.0",
    "protobuf>=5.0.0"
]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

After this change, you may want to update your development environment with:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### Thanks, that fixed it! Can you tag this as 0.1.1 and push to pypi please?  

I'll help update the version to 0.1.1 in both pyproject.toml and __init__.py.

pyproject.toml
<source>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
version = "0.1.0"
=======
version = "0.1.1"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

esdbcat/__init__.py
<source>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
__version__ = "0.1.0"
=======
__version__ = "0.1.1"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

Now you can build and publish to PyPI with these commands:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "Release version 0.1.1"
git push origin v0.1.1
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```
