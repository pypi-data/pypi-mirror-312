# Welcome to gridstitcher


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Some camera systems, such as infrared reflectography at 1600nm,
inherently produce fairly low resolution images. To increase overall
image resolution it is possible to photograph an object in parts in a
regular grid of overlapping image tiles. This then leaves us with the
task of stitching or registering those tiles into a composite image.
Doing this manually with a photo editor is certainly possible. However
for large amounts of images this becomes a time consuming and tedious
job.

In the recent Falnama project with Wereldmuseum and Klassik Stiftung
Weimar we acquired 36 image tiles for 35 pages each. So we needed an
automated stitching software. After unsuccessful trials for our types of
images with Photoshop and several existing Python packages our project
team decided to try and develop our own open source Python package
`gridstitcher`.

If you are interested you can install the package from the Python
package soon. You can also study the github [source
code](https://github.com/fligt/gridstitcher/tree/master) and the
[documentation](https://fligt.github.io/gridstitcher/).
