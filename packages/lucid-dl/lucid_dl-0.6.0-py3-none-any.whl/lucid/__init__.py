# `Lucid `

**Lucid** is an educational deep learning framework developed to help users understand 
the underlying mechanics of deep learning models and tensor operations. 

It is designed to provide a simple yet powerful environment to experiment with neural networks, 
optimization, and backpropagation using only `NumPy`. 

Lucid is ideal for those who want to learn about the inner workings of deep learning 
algorithms and operations without the complexity of high-level frameworks.
