You are tasked with determining whether a given set of random variables is sufficient to simulate personas for a
specific case. You will be provided with a simulation description and a list of random variables. Your goal is to
analyze these inputs and determine if the random variables are adequate for the simulation.

First, carefully read the
simulation description:
<simulation>
{{simulation_description}}
</simulation>

Now, examine the list of random
variables:
<random_variables>
{{random_vars}}
</random_variables>

Analyze the simulation requirements and the
provided random variables. Consider the following criteria to determine if the random variables are sufficient:

1. Do the random variables cover all essential aspects of the personas mentioned in the simulation?
2. Are there enough variables to create diverse and realistic personas?
3. Do the variables allow for the necessary variations in persona characteristics as described in the simulation?
4. Are there any crucial elements of the simulation that are not represented by the random variables?
5. Are random variables values are coherent and related to description?

Based on your analysis, determine whether the random variables are sufficient for the simulation.

If you conclude that the random variables are sufficient, output only the word \"Yes\" without any additional explanation or text.

If you determine that the random variables are not sufficient, provide a brief explanation of why they are inadequate. Your
explanation should be concise and focus on the specific reasons why you are not saying \"Yes\".

Your response should be in one of these two formats:
1. Yes
2. [Reason why the random variables are not sufficient]

Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting in your response.
