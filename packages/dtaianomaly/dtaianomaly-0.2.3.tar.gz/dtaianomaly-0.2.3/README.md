A simple-to-use Python package for the development and analysis of time series anomaly 
detection techniques. Here we describe the main usage of `dtaianomaly`, but be sure to
check out the [documentation](https://dtaianomaly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) 
for more information. 

## Installation

The preferred way to install `dtaianomaly` is via PyPi. See the [documentation](https://dtaianomaly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) 
for more options.
```
pip install dtaianomaly
```

## Features

The three key features of `dtaianomaly` are as follows:
1. State-of-the-art time series anomaly detection via a simple API.

2. Develop custom models for anomaly detection.

3. Quantitative evaluation of time series anomaly detection.

## Example

Below code shows a simple example of `dtaianomaly`, which is part of the 
[anomaly detection notebook](notebooks/Anomaly-detection.ipynb). More examples 
are provided in the [other notebooks](notebooks) and in the 
[documentation](https://dtaianomaly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

```python
from dtaianomaly.data import demonstration_time_series
from dtaianomaly.preprocessing import MovingAverage
from dtaianomaly.anomaly_detection import MatrixProfileDetector

# Load the data
X, y = demonstration_time_series()

# Preprocess the data using a moving average
preprocessor = MovingAverage(window_size=10)
X_, _ = preprocessor.fit_transform(X)

# Fit the matrix profile detector on the processed data
detector = MatrixProfileDetector(window_size=100)
detector.fit(X_)

# Compute either the decision scores, specific to the detector, or the anomaly probabilities
decision_scores = detector.decision_function(X_)
anomaly_probabilities = detector.predict_proba(X_)
```
