# SimpleBooks

SimpleBooks is a simple accounting library that uses
[sqloquent](https://pypi.org/project/sqloquent) to persist data for identities,
ledgers, accounts, transactions, and entries. Included are tools for
accomplishing basic bookkeeping tasks. The basic accounting formula is this:
`Assets = Liabilities + Equity`. Assets are debit-balance; liabilities and
equity are credit-balance. Every transaction must have entries that have no net
difference between the amount of credits and the amount of debits.

This is a simplification of [bookchain](https://pypi.org/project/bookchain): all
cryptographic features have been removed. This may be useful in scenarios when
cryptographic features cannot be supported.

## Status

All initially planned features have been implemented and tested.

Open issues can be found [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/simplebooks/issues).

The async implementation has an upstream issue from the sqloquent dependency
that can be tracked [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/sqloquent/issues/16). Once
that is fixed, the dependency will be updated, and this notice will be removed.

## Overview

This library provides an accounting system using sqloquent for persistence,
packify for deterministic encoding, and the classic rules of double-entry
bookkeeping. The `Transaction.prepare` and `Transaction.validate` ensure that
the accounting rule is followed.

### Class organization

`Currency` represents a currency/unit of account for a `Ledger`. It includes the
number of subunits to track and optionally the base for conversion to decimal
(defaults to 10), FX symbol, prefix symbol, and/or postfix symbol to be used with
the `format` method (e.g. `USD.format(1200)` could result in "12.00 USD",
"$12.00", or "12.00$", respectively). It also includes `to_decimal` method for
formatting int amounts into `Decimal`s, and `get_units` method for getting a
tuple of whole units and remainders.

`Identity` represents a legal person or other entity that can sign contracts
or engage in transactions. It includes the name, details, and optionally public
key bytes and private key seed bytes.

`Ledger` represents a general ledger for a given `Identity` using a specific
`Currency`. It includes a name, a `LedgerType`, the `Identity` id, and the
`Currency` id. `LedgerType` is an enum representing the valid ledger types,
either `PRESENT` or `FUTURE` for cash and accrual accounting, respectively, or
for other uses the package user may define.

`Account` represents an account for a given `Ledger`. It includes a name, a type
(one of the `AccountType` enum options), the `Ledger` id, an optional locking
script for access control, and optional details.

`AccountCategory` represents a category for `Account`s. It includes a name, a
`LedgerType`, and a destination (str description; e.g. "Balance Sheet" or
"Profit and Loss").

`AccountType` is an enum representing the valid account types. The options are
`DEBIT_BALANCE`, `ASSET`, `CONTRA_ASSET`, `CREDIT_BALANCE`, `LIABILITY`,
`EQUITY`, `CONTRA_LIABILITY`, and `CONTRA_EQUITY`.

`Entry` represents an entry in the general ledger for a given `Account`. It
includes a type (one of the `EntryType` enum options), an amount, a nonce, the
`Account` id, and optional details.

`EntryType` is an enum representing the valid entry types. The options are
CREDIT and DEBIT.

`Transaction` represents a transaction made of `Entry`s. It includes the `Entry`
ids, `Ledger` ids, a timestamp, and the details. Each `Transaction` must include
entries that balance the number of credits and debits applied to each ledger
affected by the transaction. Use `Transaction.prepare` to prepare a transaction
-- it will raise validation errors if the transaction is not valid -- then call
`.save()` on the result to persist it to the database. Transactions in the
database can be validated by using `.validate()`, which will return `True` if it
is valid and `False` if it is not (it will also raise errors in some situations
that require more information about the validation failure).

`Customer` and `Vendor` are provided in case they are useful in some way, but no
relations are set up for them currently. This is likely to change in a future
release.

- `Identity` has many `Ledger`s
- `Ledger` belongs to `Identity` and `Currency`, has many `Account`s, and is within `Transaction`s
- `Account` belongs to `Ledger` and `AccountCategory`, and has many `Entry`s
- `AccountCategory` has many `Account`s
- `Entry` belongs to `Account` and is within `Transaction`s
- `Transaction` contains `Ledger`s and `Entry`s

## Installation and Setup

Install with `pip install simplebooks`. If you want to use the async version,
instead install with `pip install simplebooks[asyncql]`.

Once installed, use the following to setup your project as appropriate:

```python
import simplebooks

simplebooks.publish_migrations(path_to_migrations_folder)
simplebooks.automigrate(path_to_migrations_folder, db_file_path)
simplebooks.set_connection_info(db_file_path)
```

To use the async version:

```python
import simplebooks
import simplebooks.asyncql

simplebooks.publish_migrations(path_to_migrations_folder)
simplebooks.automigrate(path_to_migrations_folder, db_file_path)
simplebooks.asyncql.set_connection_info(db_file_path)
```

## Tests

There are a total of 7 tests (2 e2e tests and 5 tests for miscellaneous
tools/features). To run them, clone the repo, set up a virtual environment
(e.g. `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`), install the
dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run the following:
`find tests -name test_*.py -print -exec python {} \;`. On Windows, the 3 test
files will have to be individually run with the following:

```bash
python tests/test_async_basic_e2e.py
python tests/test_basic_e2e.py
python tests/test_misc.py
```
