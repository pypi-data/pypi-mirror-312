# SpeedCubeTimer-TUI (sctt)

![sctt_screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5e05bc7-801d-42ba-a8ee-752c30ad5313)

It's a TUI speed cube timer app. It can generate scrambles, measure time and display the cube's state as a cube net. It can also be used on the Linux console. (A color that cannot be displayed may change to a different color that can be displayed.)
