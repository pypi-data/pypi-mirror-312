Purpose of this package
-----------------------
This Python's package is dedicated to work on mechanical elasticity-related tensors; namely: stress, strain and
stiffness/compliance tensors.

It provides a couple of ways to perform basic operations on these tensors in a user-friendly way. In addition, it
handles arrays of tensors, allowing to perform thousands of data at once (see an example :ref:`here<multidimensional-arrays>`).

It also comes with plotting features (e.g. spatial dependence of Young modulus).

Installation
------------
To install this package, simply run::

    pip install Elasticipy
