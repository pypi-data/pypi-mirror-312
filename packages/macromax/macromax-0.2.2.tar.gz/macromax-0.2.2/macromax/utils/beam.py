        Represents a single transversal section of the wave equation solution that is propagated using the beam-propagation method.
        Its main purpose is to propagate the field from one plane to the next using the ```propagate(...)``` method,
        for use in the ```Beam``` class.
        The field can be scalar or vectorial. In the latter case, the polarization must be represented by axis -4 in the
        field and field_ft arrays. Singleton dimensions must be added for lower-dimensional calculations.

        :param grid: The regularly-spaced grid at which the field values are defined. This grid can have up to three
            dimensions. By default, the third dimension from the right is the propagation dimension.
            If the grid has less than 3 dimensions, new dimensions will be added on the left.
        :param propagation_axis: The grid index of the propagation axis and that of the longitudinal polarization.
            Default: -3
        :param vacuum_wavenumber: (optional) The vacuum wavenumber in rad/m, can also be specified as wavelength.
        :param vacuum_wavelength: (optional) Vacuum wavelength, alternative for wavenumber in units of meter.
        :param background_permittivity: (optional) The homogeneous background permittivity as a scalar, default 1.
            Heterogeneous distributions are specified when querying the results from this object.
        :param background_refractive_index: (optional) Alternative to the above, the square of the permittivity.
        :param field: (optional) The field specification (at propagation distance 0).
            If it is vectorial, the polarization axis should be 4th from the right (-4).
        :param field_ft: (optional) Alternative field specification as its Fourier transform (not fftshifted).
            If the number of dimensions of field or field_ft equals that of the grid, a singleton dimension is prepended on
            the left to indicate a scalar field. Otherwise, the polarization_axis indicates whether this is a vectorial
            calculation or not. If it is vectorial, the polarization axis should be 4th from the right (-4).
        :param dtype: (optional) The complex dtype of the returned results. Default: that of field or field_ft.
        :param vectorial: (optional) Indicates scalar (False) or vectorial = polarized (True) calculations.
            Default: consisted with the size of the polarization axis of the field or field_ft array.
