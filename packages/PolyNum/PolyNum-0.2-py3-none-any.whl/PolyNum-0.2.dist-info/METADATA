# Numerical Methods and Polynomial Evaluation

This module provides tools for performing polynomial operations and solving numerical methods problems. It includes functions for polynomial evaluations, roots finding, and key numerical techniques used in computational mathematics.

## Features

- **Polynomial Evaluation**: Evaluate polynomials at a given point.
- **Polynomial Operations**: Perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on polynomials.
- **Numerical Methods**: Implement common numerical techniques like Euler's method, numerical integration, and root-finding algorithms.
- **Customizable Degree Representation**: Polynomials are represented as lists of coefficients, with the 0th index corresponding to the highest degree term.

## Installation

You can install this module via `pip` (if it's packaged) or directly from the repository:

```bash
pip install PolyNum
