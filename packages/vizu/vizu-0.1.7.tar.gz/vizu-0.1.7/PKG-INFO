Description: # Vizu - the simple CSV-viewer
        
        Doing advanced analysis of data in CSV-format can be done with many tools - Excel and Pandas are two popular choises.
        However, to quickly browse through the data for simple analysis and exploration, you will need more button-clicks than you should. 
        
        `vizu` is meant to bridge the gap by providing a simple UI to browse a CSV file.
        
        It uses the excellent libraries `dash` and `pandas` under the hood for GUI and data manipulation, respectively.
        
        ### Installation
        `pip install vizu`
        
        ### Browse your first .csv file
        Run the following command in a terminal
        
        `vizu path/to/file.csv`
        
        and go to your browser via the link it outputs.
