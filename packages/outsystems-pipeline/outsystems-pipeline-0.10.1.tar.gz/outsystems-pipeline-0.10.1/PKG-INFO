What's new
==========

**Parallel Deployments**

 The following scripts have been updated to enable creating and running parallel deployment plans:

 * `deploy_latest_tags_to_target_env.py`
 * `deploy_package_to_target_env.py`

 To enable this feature, use the following parameter:

 * `--allow_parallel_deployments`: Skips LifeTime validation for active deployment plans.

**Enhanced Pipeline Operations**

 New pipeline scripts have been added to streamline operations related to manifest files:

 * `generate_manifest_file.py`: Generates a trigger manifest file.
 * `validate_manifest_apps_exist_in_target_env.py`: Verifies that manifest applications exist in the target environment.

**Updated Package Dependencies**

 * Updated `requests` dependency to version 2.32.2
 * Added `packaging` dependency, version 24.1
