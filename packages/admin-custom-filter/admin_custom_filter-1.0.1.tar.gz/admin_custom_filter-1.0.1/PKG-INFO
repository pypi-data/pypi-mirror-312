# Getting Started

### Description
Admin custom filter package is a package will let you customize the view for the data in admin panel for each model dynamically.

### Why this package has been developed ?

Basically when you want to add custom filters, custom searches, and custom list displays, You need to add the values you want in hard coded. But if someone uses the admin panel and he has no technical knowledge to update the code. He will ask the developer each time to update the codes and wait the development process to finish.

### How this package will benefit ?
1. The admin custom filter package will help to play around with all models' fields dynamically. So, any update in the filter will be reflected directly and immediately in the platform.
2. Let say there are more than one admin in the platform, each one of them will have its unique filter. So, no overlap between them.
